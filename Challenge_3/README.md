# Challenge 3 - Balloons, Bombs and Booleans

_This challenge is part of the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway._

This folder includes:

- The prototype used and edited during the learning section ([Assets](Assets) > [Scenes](Assets/Scenes) > Prototype 3)
- The full challenge implementation ([Assets](Assets) > [Challenge 3](Assets/Challenge%203))

### Challenge Overview:

Apply your knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects to guide a balloon floating through town, collecting tokens while avoiding explosives.  
This project involves a lot of troubleshooting, as it includes several intentional bugs and broken features to fix.

### Challenge Outcome:

- The balloon floats upward as the player holds the spacebar
- The background seamlessly repeats, simulating forward movement
- Bombs and money tokens spawn randomly at timed intervals
- Collecting money triggers a particle and sound effect
- Hitting a bomb triggers an explosion, ends the game, and stops the background
- Balloon bounces when hitting the ground (bonus)
- Balloon cannot float too high (bonus)
